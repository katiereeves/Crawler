# Crawler
### Project Details
This is an ongoing project, so please bear with me.
I'm currently exploring web crawling and indexing pages.
This will be the foundation for a potential future search engine.

### How to compile
```sh
gcc -o spider spider.c -lcurl
```
You may need to install some dependencies.

### Usage
Currently, the crawler indexes web pages through brute force requests.
While method is fine, the current implementation is not my final goal.
